# <p align="center">BLOSSOM</p>

Blossom is a Fabric mod for Minecraft that makes oak leaves blossom and bear fruit! No longer do you have to destroy your tree to get those apples, now you can simply shear them off when they are grown! Bees will also pollinate the leaves, or you can fertilize them with bone meal!

### Source Building

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch Fabric-1.18 --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/blossom.git

cd ./blossom

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
